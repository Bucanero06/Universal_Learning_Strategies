### ðŸ§  My Approach to Problem Solving and Knowledge Expansion

In navigating the vast landscape of technology and innovation, I've developed a systematic approach to learning and problem-solving, especially when exploring new tools, platforms, and frameworks. This process is tailored to ensure a deep understanding and practical application, crucial for contributing effectively in high-stakes environments.

0. **WHATS THE PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED** ___________________________________ got it? It sucks to know first principles work in hindsight so don't skip! We are here to learn tools to help us through our unknowns so we don't become stuck for too long.

1. **Starting with Industry Standards and Outliers**: I begin by familiarizing myself with both widely used and niche tools, comparing their applications in open-source communities and the private sector. This helps in understanding their utility and setting realistic expectations.

2. **Naive Beginner's Exploration**: I approach new platforms with a beginner's mindset, allowing myself to be guided by their documentation while making personal notes. This step is crucial for understanding the onboarding process and evaluating the tool's accessibility and learning curve.

3. **API Mastery and Practical Application**: Learning by doing is key. I dive into the API, undertaking projects that can be deployed in production or run locally, to gain hands-on experience.

4. **Deep Dive into Abstract Concepts**: I identify and explore the more complex topics encountered across various tools, forming strong conceptual understandings that act as nodes for further branching and exploration.

5. **Developing MVPs and Analyzing Viability**: Designing and developing MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) of my own concepts allows me to test how these tools fit into my broader technological landscape. I consider maintenance requirements, integration with my existing workflows, and the potential for these tools to aid in my growth and problem-solving.

6. **Reconciliation and Strategic Planning**: Finally, I synthesize my findings, reconciling similar tools and ideas to form a more concrete understanding of my needs, desires, and potential areas of exploration. This phase is about separating genuine utility from mere curiosity, ensuring that my focus remains aligned with my long-term goals and the requirements of cutting-edge technological fields.

Through this process, I not only expand my toolkit but also refine my ability to adapt, learn, and apply new technologies effectively â€“ a skill set I believe is essential for contributing to the unknown future.
